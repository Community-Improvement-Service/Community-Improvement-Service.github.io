For this workshop, we are honored to be able to partner with All American Medical Group (AAMG) and Cameron House which both are knowledgeable and resourceful organizations in the health sector. In this workshop, we explained some general and common mental health questions from the youth of our community. On top of that, techniques to coup with and identify negative feelings were also provided; not only for youth, but we have also made approaches to mental health from parents' perspectives within this workshop. Through such workshop event, we hope to be able to raise awareness and educate others about mental health!","VideoLink":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/McmHHy4Lm9g, https://www.youtube.com/embed/s3TC11MsDIw","Show":true,"Image":null},{"Title":"Educational Workshops","Description":"Are you ready for a driver’s license or want to learn more about it?
